# GraphVisualizer

GraphVisualizer is a C++ program that generates visual representations of undirected graphs using the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm.

---

## Overview
This program takes a text file containing the description of an undirected graph as input and generates a graphical representation of the graph in BMP format.

### Features:
- Supports undirected graphs with up to 500 vertices.
- Uses the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for graph layout.
- Produces graphical representations with minimal edge crossings.
- Customizable vertex and edge size.
